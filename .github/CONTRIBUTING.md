# Contribution guide

We appreciate your thought to contribute to open source. :heart: We want to make contributing as easy as possible. You are welcome to:

- Report a bug
- Discuss the current state of the code
- Submit a fix
- Propose new features

We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull
requests. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code, check one of the examples.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Raise a pull request.

## Documentation

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for some default checks which are fast and find the most common errors.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the license available at
[LICENSE](blob/main/LICENSE).
